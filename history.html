    <h2>Edinburgh Through the Ages</h2>
    <p>
      Edinburgh’s story stretches back to the dawn of time—with evidence of human settlement at Cramond dating to around 8500 BC. Over millennia, the naturally fortified Castle Rock emerged as a strategic stronghold, eventually becoming home to the legendary Edinburgh Castle.

    <h2>Edinburgh as Scotland’s Capital</h2>
    <p>
      By the 15th century, Edinburgh was established as Scotland’s capital, thriving as a center of trade, learning, and governance. Even amidst religious upheavals and battles, the city prospered. The 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment turned Edinburgh into a vibrant hub of intellectual and cultural innovation, earning it the title "Athens of the North." The creation of the spacious New Town alongside the ancient Old Town introduced a unique dual character to the city.

    <h2>Industrial Shifts and Modern Resurgence</h2>
    <p>
      Although Edinburgh once reigned as Scotland’s largest city, the industrial boom of the 19th century saw Glasgow take the lead in production and commerce. Despite this, Edinburgh maintained its status as the nation's cultural and political heart. The 20th century heralded a new era with the addition of museums, iconic monuments, and, in 1999, the revival of the Scottish Parliament—a symbolic return to self-governance.

    <h2>Life in Medieval Edinburgh</h2>
    <p>
      In its earliest days, a modest fort known as Dun Eiden stood on Castle Rock, later renamed by invading Angles who merged “Eiden” with the Old English “Burh” (fort) to form “Edinburgh.” As the royal castle took shape around the 12th century, settlements burgeoned on the east side of the Rock, and Edinburgh began engaging in international trade. The period also saw the rise of friars—Dominicans in black and Augustinians in grey—who played an active role in community life.

    <h2>The 16th &amp; 17th Centuries: Crowded and Challenging</h2>
    <p>
      Around 1500, Edinburgh’s population was modest, but by mid-century, it had swelled significantly. Following the 1513 Battle of Flodden, residents built the Flodden Wall as a defensive measure, though it offered little protection. With space at a premium, multi-story houses sprang up along The Royal Mile—stone structures capped with wooden extensions. This rapid growth also brought harsh living conditions, with plagues, fires, and unsanitary practices frequently plaguing the city.

    <h2>The 18th Century: Reinventing the City</h2>
    <p>
      Faced with the challenges of the old city's cramped conditions, visionary planners proposed an ambitious expansion. In 1767, James Craig’s award-winning design introduced Edinburgh’s elegant New Town, characterized by wide streets, open squares, and verdant gardens. This transformation not only alleviated overcrowding but also attracted a surge of intellectuals, making the city a beacon of philosophy, science, and art.

    <h2>From Industrial Era to Tourist Gem</h2>
    <p>
      As the 19th century progressed, while Glasgow grew as an industrial powerhouse, Edinburgh preserved its charm through its rich cultural heritage and architectural splendor. The completion of the New Town and a wave of immigration enriched the city’s fabric, with landmarks like Calton Hill and the Scott Monument emerging during this time. In the modern era, Edinburgh has become a top tourist destination, symbolized by the revival of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and the city's continuous evolution as a center of art, culture, and history.
