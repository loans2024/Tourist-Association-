    <h2>Qatar's Ancient Beginnings</h2>
    <p>
      Qatar's history dates back over 50,000 years, with archaeological discoveries revealing ancient settlements and rock carvings from the Neolithic period. Early inhabitants were nomadic Bedouin tribes who thrived on fishing, pearling, and trading. The strategic location of the Qatar Peninsula made it a significant crossroads for maritime trade between Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and Persia.

    <h2>The Age of Pearling and Maritime Trade</h2>
    <p>
      By the 18th and 19th centuries, Qatar had established itself as one of the world’s most important pearling hubs. The pristine waters of the Arabian Gulf provided ideal conditions for natural pearls, which were highly sought after in European and Asian markets. This lucrative industry defined Qatar’s economy for centuries, sustaining local communities and creating a thriving trade network with India and the Ottoman Empire.

    <h2>Colonial Struggles and the Birth of a Nation</h2>
    <p>
      During the 19th century, Qatar was under Ottoman rule, but tensions between local tribes and the Ottomans led to resistance. In 1916, Qatar became a British protectorate, marking a period of political transformation. The ruling Al Thani family played a key role in shaping Qatar’s governance, leading the country toward independence.
